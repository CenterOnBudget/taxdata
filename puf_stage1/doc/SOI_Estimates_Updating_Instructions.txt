This document provides instructions for updating the 'SOI_estimates.csv' file
found in the Stage I folder. Updating this file also requires updating
Stage I.py to avoid conflict.

Additional instructions adding new targets are also included in this file

The data comes from the individual statistical tables from IRS SOI Tax-Stats:
www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-statistical-tables-by-size-of-adjusted-gross-income

Updates should occur when a new year of data is released. To update the
document, open SOI_estimates.csv and add a new column for that year.

The table where each variable can be found as well as the column in said table
can be found in 'Data Source.xlsx'. Most variables are from one column alone,
but there are three that require adding up the values in multiple columns. The
necessary columns are specified in the file.

Changes Required in Stage I.py:

    - Update the last year in 'historical_index' to be one greater than the
      last year in the newly updated SOI_estimates.
    - Update the first year in the for loop to match the last year in the newly
      updated SOI_estimates.

Adding New Targets:

    If adding a new target to the list in SOI_estimates, be sure to add its
    value for all years in the file, not just the latest.

    Changes to Stage I.py:
        - Add the new target to the list of targets calculated in the for loop
        - Add the new target to the 'current_year' DataFrame

    Changes to Single_Year_Stage_II.py:
        - Add code to calculate the target like all other targets currently
          estimated.
        - Add target to 'One_half_LHS' and the lists 'b' and 'temp'.
